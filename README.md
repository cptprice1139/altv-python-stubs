# altv-python-stubs

# What is this?
This is a file to allow autocomplete for the alt:V Python Module. Due to the module not being an actual python package, autocomplete without this will not work.

# How do I use stubs?
Add the `alt.pyi` file to your projects source folder in `typings/` and providing you have the vscode Python extension installed, autocomplete should kick in.

# Wget and cURL
```
wget -o ./typings/alt.pyi https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZackaryH8/altv-python-stubs/master/alt.pyi
curl -o ./typings/alt.pyi https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZackaryH8/altv-python-stubs/master/alt.pyi
```
